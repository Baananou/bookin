# bookin

This is a school project where i created a microservices based web application in wich i used, 3 diffrent architectures ( QraphQl, Rest, GRPC )

So i devided the projet on 2 main parts:

# Backend
Where i have 3 Microservices:

## Inventory
Book Inventory Management microservice using REST: This microservice is responsible for managing the book inventory, including adding new books, updating existing books, and deleting books. It uses REST architecture to provide simple, resource-oriented APIs for performing CRUD operations on the book inventory.

## Recommendations
Book Recommendations microservice using GraphQL: This microservice is responsible for providing personalized book recommendations to users based on their reading history, preferences, and other factors. It uses GraphQL architecture to expose a flexible, data-intensive API that can fetch and combine data from multiple sources to generate the best recommendations.

## Orders
Order Management microservice using gRPC: This microservice is responsible for managing the book orders, including creating new orders, updating order status, and handling payments. It uses gRPC architecture to provide efficient, high-performance APIs for handling real-time order processing and communication with payment gateways.

# Frontend
